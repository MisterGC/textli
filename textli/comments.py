"""Inline comment format for the markdown editor — CriticMarkup span comments.

A comment is stored inline in the markdown as a CriticMarkup highlight directly
followed by a comment::

    The {==quarterly numbers==}{>>are these pre-audit?<<} look off here.

`{==…==}` marks the highlighted span; `{>>…<<}` is the comment body. The two are
written adjacent (the comment tool always emits them that way). This module is
the single source of truth for that format: parsing it, stripping it for a plain
render, and preparing a sentinel-wrapped variant the read view can highlight.

It also owns the rest of the CriticMarkup vocabulary — `{++insert++}`,
`{--delete--}`, `{~~old~>new~~}` — as inline *suggestions* (track-changes), so an
agent or the human can propose edits the reader reviews (accept/reject) instead
of silently rewriting the prose. See the "Suggestions" section at the bottom.

Pure text logic only — no Qt — so it is cheap to unit-test and reusable by any
render or export path.
